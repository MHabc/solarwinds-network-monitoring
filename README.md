# üì° Network Monitoring Project with SolarWinds NPM

> Implementation of a real-time network performance monitoring system using **SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor (NPM)**, combined with network simulation in GNS3 and VMware.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Build a simulated network topology with multiple nodes (routers, switches, servers)

- Configure performance monitoring with **SolarWinds NPM**

- Enable automatic email alerts when failures or overloads occur

- Test real-world scenarios such as node down, CPU overload, and connectivity loss

## üõ† Technologies & Tools

| Component        | Technology / Tool             |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| Network Monitoring    | SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor (NPM) |
| Network Simulation    | GNS3 + VMware (Windows Server) |
| Monitoring Protocols| SNMP (v2, v3), ICMP          |
| Email Alerts   | SMTP configured in SolarWinds |
| Client Devices | Windows, Linux (agentless or SNMP-enabled) |

## üß™ Implemented Features

- Monitoring of network device performance (CPU, RAM, availability)

- Alerts for connectivity loss and resource overload

- Centralized management of multiple network nodes from a single dashboard
  
- Real-time performance charting and visualization
  
- Scheduled reports and detailed statistics
